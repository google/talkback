         movement of 1cm takes longer than this value, we assume it's a slow movement, and
         therefore not a gesture.

         This value was determined by measuring the time for the first
         1cm movement when gesturing, and touch exploring.  Based on user testing, all gestures
         started with the initial movement taking less than 100ms. When touch exploring,
         the first movement almost always takes longer than 200ms. -->
