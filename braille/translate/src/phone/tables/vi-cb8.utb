# FIXME: Consider changing type to literary. Strictly speaking this
# isn't computer braille because there is no one-to-one mapping for
# Vietnamese accented characters. Due to lack of a proper and official
# recommendation for computer braille this is the generally accepted
# way to do it.

# Vietnam hasn't have any official computer Braille code, except a long time accepted approach as using same US ansi codes + Vietnamese letters with accents.
# Letter with accent is translated one on one, instead of applying rule to move accent to correct position.
