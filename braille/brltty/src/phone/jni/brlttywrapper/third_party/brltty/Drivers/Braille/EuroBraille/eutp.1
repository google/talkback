.SH SHELL EXPANSIONS
Beware of special chars: * and . are often expanded by your shell, hence
\fIsending files *\fR will probably do what you want, putting every file existing in
the current directory onto the terminal, but \fI receiving files *\fR may not do what you
want: it will only get every file which already exist in the current
directory, skipping those you just created on your terminal !
If you want to get every file which exist in the terminal, you
should use \fI'*'\fR or something similar (please read your shell manual).

The same warning applies to other special chars, such as $, ~, &,... which
should be protected by surrounding arguments by quotes (') or by using single
backslashes (\\) just before them (please read your shell manual).
