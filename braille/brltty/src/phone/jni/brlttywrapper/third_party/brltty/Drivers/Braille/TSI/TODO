Coexistance of the key bindings for Nav 40, Nav 80, PB40 and PB80 is
becoming difficult to manage, and impossible to customize. Should
consider splitting the layouts. Also should check how others thought of
doing user-configurable bindings. Finally should consider some mechanism
for automatic help file generation, because they are a nuisance to
maintain as well.
