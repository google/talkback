.SH NAME
vstpg, vstpp \- VisioBraille file transferring
.SH SYNOPSIS
vstpg [\-ifbnd] [\-s \fIsocketport\fP] [\-k \fIkeyname\fP] [\-o \fIconfigname\fP] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIvstpg\fP (resp. \fIvstpp\fP) gets (resp. puts) files from (resp. onto)
a VisioBraille terminal.

For communicating with the terminal, you must launch brltty with the BrlNet
driver, and telling BrlNet to use the VisioBraille driver.

Before putting on the terminal, file names are truncated to 8 characters
without any extension.

Before getting from terminal, leading path and trailing extensions are removed,
but put back for local filename.

.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-i\fR
ask for confirmation of transfer, for each file (on the terminal)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
don't ask for such a confirmation (default)
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
if they exists, recursively rename the old files with an added .x suffix,
just like logrotate does
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
do not keep such backup file (default)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsocketport\fR
use socketport as the port number instead of default for connecting to BrlNet
.TP
\fB\-k\fR \fIfilename\fR
use filename as key path instead of default for reading BrlNet's
authentication key
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
use current directory rather than the download directory
(see \fIvbs_dir\fR below)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfilename\fR
also read filename as config file

.SH CONFIG FILE

\fIvstpg\fP and \fIvstpp\fP read a configuration file \fB$HOME/.vstprc\fR which
contains keywords or equalities, one per line (what follows a # is
ignored).

You can ask them to also read any other file thanks to the \fB\-o\fR option.

Here are keywords:

.TP
\fBbackup\fR
make \fB\-b\fR option the default

.TP
\fBnobackup\fR
make \fB\-f\fR option the default

.TP
and equalities:

.TP
\fBkeyname\fR = \fIfilename\fR
use this file instead of default, to find BrlNet's authentication key

.TP
\fBsocketport\fR = \fIport\fR
use this port number, instead of default, to connect to BrlNet

.TP
\fBvbs_ext\fR = \fI.ext\fR
use .ext as an extension for downloaded files (.vis by default)
this is overridden on command line if an extension is provided in the file name

.TP
\fBvbs_dir\fR = \fIpath\fR
use path instead of current directory for putting files, except when
using the \fB\-d\fR option, or if the filename begins with '.'

.SH RETURNED VALUE

.TS
lB lfCW.
1	syntax error on command line
2	connection with BrlNet error
3	Unix file error
4	Protocol error
16	interrupted by user
.TE

.SH SHELL EXPANSIONS
Beware of special chars: * and . are often expanded by your shell, hence
\fIvstpp *\fR will probably do what you want, putting every file existing in
the current directory onto the terminal, but \fIvstpg *\fR may not do what you
want: it will only get every file which already exist in the current
directory, skipping those you just created on your terminal !
If you want to get every file which exist in the terminal, you
should use \fIvstpg '*'\fR or something similar (please read your shell manual).

The same warning applies to other special chars, such as $, ~, &,... which
should be protected by surrounding arguments by quotes (') or by using single
backslashes (\\) just before them (please read your shell manual).

.SH BUGS
The one we could find has been corrected :)
