 * Before being able to write on the braille display, the application must tell

 *
 * The application must also specify how braille keys will be delivered to it.
 * Two ways are possible: key codes and commands:
 *
 * - key codes are specific to each braille driver, since the raw key code, as
 *   defined in the driver will be given for each key press.
 *   Using them leads to building highly driver-dependent applications, which
 *   can yet sometimes be useful to mimic existing proprietary applications
 *   for instance.
 * - commands means that applications will get exactly the same values as
 *   \e brltty. This allows driver-independent clients, which will hopefully
 *   be nice to use with a lot of different terminals.

 * \brief Write text to the braille display

 *
 * \note Be sure to call brlapi_enterTtyMode() \e before calling brlapi_write(), or
 * else you'll get an error. This is particularly not always trivial when
 * writing multithreaded applications.
 *
 * \note Dots are coded as described in ISO/TR 11548-1: a dot pattern is coded
 * by a byte in which bit 0 is set iff dot 1 is up, bit 1 is set iff dot 2 is
 * up, ... bit 7 is set iff dot 8 is up. This also corresponds to the low-order
 * byte of the coding of unicode's braille row U+2800.
 *
 * \note Text is translated by the server one to one, by just using a simple
 * wchar_t to pattern table, i.e. no contraction/expansion is performed, because
 * the client would then have no way to know how wide the output would be and
 * thus the quantity of text to feed.  If contraction/expansion is desired, the
 * client should perform it itself (e.g. thanks to liblouis or gnome-braille)
 * and send the resulting dot patterns.  This is actually exactly the same
 * problem as font rendering on a graphical display: for better control,

/** Read a key from the braille keyboard
 *
 * This function returns one key press's code.
 *
 * If NULL or "" was given to brlapi_enterTtyMode(), a \e brltty command is returned,
 * as described in the documentation for ::brlapi_keyCode_t . It is hence pretty
 * driver-independent, and should be used by default when no other option is
 * possible.
 *
 * By default, all commands but those which restart drivers and switch
 * virtual terminals are returned to the application and not to brltty.
 * If the application doesn't want to see some command events,
 * it should call brlapi_ignoreKeys()
 *
 * If some driver name was given to brlapi_enterTtyMode(), a raw keycode is returned,
 * as specified by the terminal driver, usually in <brltty/brldefs-xy> where xy
 * is the driver's code. It generally corresponds to the very code that the
 * terminal tells to the driver.
 * This should only be used by applications which are dedicated to a particular
 * braille terminal. Hence, checking the terminal type thanks to a call to
 * brlapi_getDriverName() before getting tty control is a pretty good idea.
 *
 * By default, all the keypresses will be passed to the client, none will go
 * through brltty, so the application will have to handle console switching
 * itself for instance.
 *
 * \param wait tells whether the call should block until a key is pressed (1)
 *  or should only probe key presses (0);
 * \param code holds the key code if a key press is indeed read.
 *
 * \return -1 on error or signal interrupt and *code is then undefined, 0 if
 * block was 0 and no key was pressed so far, or 1 and *code holds the key code.
 *
 * Programming hints:
 *
 * If your application is only driven by braille command keypresses, you can
 * just call brlapi_readKey(1, &code) so that it keeps blocking, waiting for
 * keypresses.
 *
 * Else, you'll probably want to use the file descriptor returned by
 * brlapi_openConnection() in your "big polling loop". For instance:
 *
 * - in a \c select() loop, just add it to the \c readfds and \c exceptfds file
 *   descriptor sets;
 * - in a gtk or atspi application, use
 *   \c g_io_add_watch(fileDescriptor, \c G_IO_IN|G_IO_ERR|G_IO_HUP, \c f, \c data)
 *   for adding a callback called \c f;
 * - in an Xt/Xaw/motif-based application, use
 *   \c XtAppAddInput(app_context, \c fileDescriptor, \c XtInputReadMask|XtInputExceptMask, \c f, \c data)
 * - etc.
 *
 * and then, when you detect inbound trafic on the file descriptor, do something
 * like this:
 *
 * while (brlapi_readKey(0, &code) {
 *    // process keycode code
 *    // ...
 * }
 *
 * The \c while loop is needed for processing \e all pending key presses, else
 * some of them may be left in libbrlapi's internal key buffer and you wouldn't
 * get them immediately.
 *
 * \note If the read is interrupted by a signal, brlapi_readKey() will return
 * -1, brlapi_errno will be BRLAPI_ERROR_LIBCERR and errno will be EINTR.

/** \defgroup brlapi_error Error handling
 * \brief How to handle errors
 *
 * When a function fails, ::brlapi_errno will hold an error
 * code to explain why it failed. It should always be reported somehow.
 *
 * Although most errors are reported that way, some (called exceptions)
 * are reported asynchronously for efficiency reasons, because they always
 * just report a programming error. The affected functions are: brlapi_setFocus,
 * brlapi_write* and brlapi_sendRaw.  When they happen, the next call to
 * brlapi_something will close the connection and call the \e exception
 * handler. If the exception handler returns, the brlapi_something function will
 * return an end-of-file error.
 *
 * The default exception handler (brlapi_defaultExceptionHandler()) dumps
 * the guilty packet before abort()ing.  It can be replaced by calling
 * brlapi_setExceptionHandler().  For instance, the Java and Python bindings use
 * this for raising a Java or Python exception that may be caught.
