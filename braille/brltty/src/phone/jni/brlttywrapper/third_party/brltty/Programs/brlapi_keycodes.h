/** \defgroup brlapi_keycodes Types and Defines for \e BrlAPI Key Codes
 *
 * Key codes are unsigned 64 bit integers.  This 64-bit space is split into 3
 * parts:
 *
 * - bits 63-32 (BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK), flags: bits 39-32 are standard X
 * modifiers (shift, control, meta, ...). Other flags are used for some commands,
 * see documentation of BRLAPI_KEY_FLG_* for their respective uses.
 * - bits 31-29 (BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK), key type: either BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD for
 * braille commands, or BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM for standard X keysyms.
 * - bits 28-0 (BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK), key code: for braille commands, see
 * BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_* ; for standard X keysyms, this is the keysym value, see
 * X11 documentation, a complete list is probably available on your system in
 * /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
 *
 * The third part is itself split into two parts: a command number and a command
 * value.  The relative sizes of these parts vary according to the key type.
 *
 * For a braille command, bits 28-16 (BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_BLK_MASK) hold the braille
 * command number, while bits 15-0 (BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ARG_MASK) hold the command
 * value.
 *
 * For a X keysym, if it is a unicode keysym (0x1uvwxyz), then the command
 * number part is 0x1000000 and the value part is 0xuvwxyz. Else, the command
 * part is held by bits 28-8 and the value part is held by bits 7-0. This
 * permits to easily handle usual cases like 0x00xy (latin1), 0x01xy (latin2),
 * XK_Backspace (0xff08, backspace), XK_Tab (0xff09, tab), ...
 *
 * For instance, if key == 0x0000000020010008,
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD, so it's a braille
 * command
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_BLK_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ROUTE, so it's the
 * braille route command.
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_ARG_MASK) == 8, so the highlighted cell is the 9th
 * one (cells are numbered from 0)
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == 0, so no modifier key was pressed during
 * the command, and no particular flag applies to the command.
 *
 * if key == 0x000000010000FF09,
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM, so it's a keysym
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK) == XK_Tab, so it's the tab key.
 * BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_TAB can also be used here, as well as a few other
 * BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_* constants which are provided to avoid having to include
 * X11/keysymdef.h
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_FLG_SHIFT, so the shift
 * modifier was pressed during the command.
 *
 * in the X11 standard some keysyms are directly unicode, for instance if
 * key == 0x0000000001001EA0,
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_MASK) == BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM, so it's a keysym
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_UNICODE) != 0 so it's a unicode keysym, whose value
 * is key & (BRLAPI_KEY_SYM_UNICODE-1).  Of course, one can also consider
 * (key & BRLAPI_KEY_CODE_MASK) == XK_Abelowdot
 * - (key & BRLAPI_KEY_FLAGS_MASK) == 0, so no modifier key was pressed during
 * the command, and no particular flag applies to the command.
 *
 * The brlapi_expandKeyCode() function may be used for splitting key codes into
 * these parts.
