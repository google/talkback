Help: EuroBraille
      Driver developped by Yannick PLASSIARD and Olivier BERT

To enter in the Learn-Mode, press #+L (on notebraille/clio), Alpha+L8 (for 
Scriba) or Level1+L7 (on Iris - Level1 may be performed by pressing 
FG+FB simultaneously).
For Esys put LeftJoystick in the "Right" position and RightJoystick in the 
"Up" position.

Using Cut And Paste
-------------------
	To begin a block, press "*E" or Beta+L1 or Layer2+L1 depending on your
braille display and then click on the cell where you want to start the block.
To end a block press "*M" or Beta+L9 or Layer2+l8 depending on your braille 
display, and click on the cell where you want to end the block. 
When you do this, the block is copied into the BRLTTY clipboard, waiting to 
be pasted anywhere you want. To paste a block,
press the "*L" or Beta+L8 or Layer2+L7 depending on your braille display. 
A separate help file for each model will be created soon.

Note
----
Please note that the README file contains also version information and
copyright notice, so if you find a bug that was not listed out in the README
file, feel free to send an e-mail to me (yan@mistigri.org), because it's
hard to test all possible functions, even if I use the driver 10 hours a day. 

Thank you.
